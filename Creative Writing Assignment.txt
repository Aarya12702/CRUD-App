“Give me that medallion” shouted Augustus as they headed deeper into the catacombs. Lucius who was getting increasingly restless had already dropped the medallion thrice which was the key to the door that led to the treasure. Augustus now having control started the leading the team of 4 treasure hunters. Julia was anxious but she was fixated on finding the treasure while Maximus was focused on confronting any danger approaching them. It all began when Augustus read about the ancient legend about a treasure so huge that it would suffice a person’s 4 generations to come. 
Julia who didn’t believe the story at first became a believer when she actually found a medallion exactly as described in the ancient legend that Augustus had stated and hence they all started to slowly believing the story. Augustus who really wanted to find the story convinced the four to go into the dangerous catacombs to search for the treasure, but little did they know it was a plot by a notorious criminal gang to kidnap innocent citizens such as Augustus and his friends and use them for their own benefit.
